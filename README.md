# AirBnB MongoDB Analysis
## Data Set Details
### Origin & Format
The origin of my data set is [AirBnB listings data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), a web page that records global AirBnB data. For this assignment, I chose AirBnB data from San Francisco, California, United States. It is a list of AirBnB in San Francisco area with information such as their host name, locations, and rating. The original data file was in **CVS** format.  

### Raw Data Example
Here is a display of the first 10 rows of my data.

I teach nineteenth-century British literature at NC State University, my husband writes philosophy textbooks, and we spend summers in southwest France.  We eventually plan to move back to the Bay Area, which we miss terribly, though there are certainly worse places to live than Raleigh and the Research Triangle.

Anyone who has driven across the Bay Bridge from SF to Oakland has seen the Cityâ€™s most visible and historic Clock Tower building off to the right; a building that once housed the largest printing company on the West coast.|NEIGHBORHOOD <br />Beyond conveniently located in the heart of SOMA in the South Beach neighborhood â€“ basically at the center of SFâ€™s tech universe. Walk just a few blocks to access fine dining, ample shopping, art galleries, Giants baseball stadium, financial district, Ferry building shops/dining, waterfront exercise/activities along the Embarcadero, entertainment venues, and many transit routes. Access wine country, the East Bay, Marin, or the South Bay easily via freeway access, which is only blocks away as well. Many tech bus routes to/from Silicone Valley also have stops in this neighborhood.                                                                                                                  |https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/445a165e-de89-4593-a8d9-671f7193bc37.jpg|3793516 |https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3793516 |Audrey   |10/7/2012 |Oakland, CA         |I am a lover of design, travel and making a difference as an individual, as a means to create change in our ever evolving world.  I am an artist, property manager and designer, entrepreneur, lover of good food and good people.  I come from the hills of Pennsylvania followed by 20 years in New York City, before coming  west to find a more balanced, creative and authentic lifestyle in the San Francisco Bay area.  I enjoy refurbishing my 100-plus-year old triplex in Oakland with my partner and dogs, immersing myself in other cultures and countries, good food, small company performances, film festivals, architecture, art, fashion, sunny days, and social responsibility.

### Data Srubbing
I used a python code to select several columns that are relevent for this assignment and delete those that are irrelevant. The python code can be found here at [data_scrubbing](/data_scrubbing.py). 

After the first step, the data only includes **'id','name','host_id','host_name','host_is_superhost','neighbourhood','neighbourhood_group_cleansed','price','beds','review_scores_rating'**. 


## Data Analysis
1. show exactly two documents from the `listings` collection in any order. I showed the first two documents from the 'listings' collection. Here are the input and the output.
```
db.listings.find().limit(2)
```
```

  }
]
```

2. show exactly 10 documents in any order, but "prettyprint" in easier to read format, using the `pretty()` function.
```
db.listings.find().limit(10).pretty()

3. choose two hosts (by reffering to their `host_id` values) who are superhosts (available in the `host_is_superhost` field), and show all of the listings offered by both of the two hosts
   - only show the `name`, `price`, `neighbourhood`, `host_name`, and `host_is_superhost` for each result

I first search for the first two superhost.
```
db.listings.find({ "host_is_superhost": "t" }, { "host_id": 1 }).limit(2)
```
```

```

5. find all of the places that have more than 2 `beds` in a neighborhood of your choice (referred to as either the `neighborhood` or `neighbourhood_group_cleansed` fields in the data file), ordered by `review_scores_rating` descending
   - only show the `name`, `beds`, `review_scores_rating`, and `price`
   - if your data set only has blanks for all the neighborhood-related fields, or only one neighborhood value in all documents, you may pick another field to filter by - include an explanation and justification for this in your report.
   - if you run out of memory for this query, try filtering `review_scores_rating` that aren't empty (`$ne`); and lastly, if there's still an issue, you can set the `beds` to match exactly 2.

I first try to see how many neighborhood are there inside the data.

We can see that the more beds there are in an AirBnB, the more likely it is going to have a higher rating. This is probably due to the fact that more beds means a bigger house and probably also a better quality. 

AirBnB with one bed have the lower ratings, probably due to the limited space of the room and it's possible that people have to share a common space with other people for those rooms.
